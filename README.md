# Sentiment-analysis-and-modelling-of-Twitter-data---US-2020-Presidential-election.

We explore  sentiment  classification  with  a  systematic  approach:  the  task  is  three-class positive/neutral/negative  classification,  the  text  being  analysed  is  not  a  random  text  document but rather directed towards  a political  topic. A series of  three-class sentiment analysis classification  was conducted on a set  of 7,000 tweets produced during the run-up to the United  States  Presidential election held in November 2020 achieves 92% accuracy using supervised learning and a recurrent artificial neural network.

Python was used for this analysis and classification because of its broad standard libraries available for various applications such as data analysis  and machine learning modelling. The goal of this project was to predict the sentiment of a tweet about a particular party leader using the sentiment analysis method and the classifier implemented.
